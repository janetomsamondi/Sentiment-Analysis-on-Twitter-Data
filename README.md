# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Twitter-Data
Social media has recieved more attention nowdays, with the freedom of speech in most countries.Social media users are expressing their views widely on social media platforms.
Twitter is among the social media platforms gaining popularity.
Developing a program for sentiment analysis is an approach to be used to computationally measure  perceptions of targeted groups.
I will be using sentiment analysis tools like TextBlob and machine learning,with BERT.
My project here involves collection of data from twiter,related tweets across Kenya.
I then , after data preprocessing, use this data to perform sentiment analysis focusing on the topic:IMPACT OF THE ONGOING POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY.
My source of data is purely from twitter, with interest on #Political campaign,#LowerFoodPrices, #Economy  and the main poloticians involved as my search queries.
  
  
 TextBlob results: Neutral     429
                   Positive    375
                   Negative    196
 Out of the samples, we can see a highest number are Neutral on the topic. I assumed maybe it is because of the previous political histroy in the country, and it can also be a sign that many citizens have lost hope on the political class. Even though a good number still have positive sentiments on the topic. It is also good to note how low the number is with the negative sentiments, which is a good sign for the post election period. 
 
 I also used the pretrained transfer leraning model: BERT Model.
 with an accuracy score of 
 
 
 
 In conclusion: the sampled data represents a good image on the ongoing political campaign, and analysing the data gives us a peak at the sentiment.
               i also learn that data cleaning and preprocessing is really crucial for modelling.
 Sentiment analysis therefore,allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics.
