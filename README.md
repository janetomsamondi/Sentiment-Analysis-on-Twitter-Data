# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Twitter-Data
Social media has recieved more attention nowdays, with the freedom of speech in most countries.Social media users are expressing their views widely on social media platforms.
Twitter is among the socila media platforms gaining popularity.
Developing a program for sentiment analysis is an approach to be used to computationally measure  perceptions of targeted groups.
I will be using sentiment analysis tools like TextBlob and machine learning,with BERT.
My project here involves collection of data from twiter,related tweets across Kenya.
I then , after data preprocessing, use this data to perform sentiment analysis focusing on the topic:IMPACT OF THE ONGOING POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY.
My source of data is purely from twitter, with interest on #Political campaign, #Foodprices,#LowerFoodPrices, #Economy as my search queries.
